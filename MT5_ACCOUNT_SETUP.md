# 🎯 MT5 Account Setup - Important Information

## ⚠️ Important Discovery

You registered with **MetaQuotes/MT5 Platform** directly, not with a forex broker.

**What this means:**
- Your login: **mikkyicon** is a MetaQuotes ID
- This is NOT a trading account (yet!)
- You need to register with an actual forex broker to trade

---

### Two Different Types of Accounts:

### 1️⃣ MetaQuotes ID (What you have now)

## ⚠️ About "CribMarket"

I noticed you mentioned "CribMarket" earlier.

**Did you register with:**
- ✅ An actual broker called CribMarket?
- ❌ Or was it just the MT5 platform registration?

**If CribMarket is a real broker:**
- Check their website
- Login to their client portal
- Look for "MT5 Accounts" or "Trading Accounts"
- Find your MT5 server name there

**If you just registered with MT5 platform:**
- That's not a trading account
- You need to register with a broker (like XM, Exness, etc.)

Reality: MT5 is just software → Need broker account to trade
