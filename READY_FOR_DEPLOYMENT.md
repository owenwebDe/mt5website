## ⚠️ Known Considerations

### 1. Python Packages
- ✅ Code is ready
- ⚠️ May need internet/proxy fix to install MetaTrader5 package
- ✅ Will work once pip can access PyPI

### 2. MT5 Connection
- ✅ Code is ready
- ⚠️ Needs valid MT5 broker account to test
- ✅ Will work with any broker (XM, Exness, etc.)

### 3. Render Free Tier
- ⚠️ Backend sleeps after 15 min inactivity
- ⚠️ Takes ~30s to wake up on first request
- ✅ Perfect for demos
- ✅ Can upgrade to $7/month to prevent sleep
